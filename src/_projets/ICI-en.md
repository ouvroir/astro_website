The Inscribed Capitals Index (ICI) presents instances of capitals with  lapidary inscriptions (ca.1080-1160) available for scholarly research in a searchable electronic format. The individual record for each capital  includes a description of the capital, its location indicated on a floor plan (when possible), and transcription and translation of the  inscription. Data is presented in a tabular layout, allowing users to  sort and filter according to categories. The ICI is not a static  catalog. Instead the site's functionality allows for updates and  expansion. At present, the ICI concentrates on inscribed capitals  located in France with plans to eventually include Spain, England, and  Italy.
